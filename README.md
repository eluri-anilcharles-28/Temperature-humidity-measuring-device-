# Temperature and Humidity Measuring Device üå°Ô∏èüíß
### Overview
A simple environmental monitoring system that measures real-time temperature and humidity levels using the **DHT11 sensor**.  
The readings are displayed on a **16x2 LCD screen**. Built using **Arduino UNO R3**.  
All programming and circuit design were done by myself (E.ANIL CHARLES).

### Components Used
- Arduino UNO R3  
- DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor  
- 16x2 JHD LCD Display  
- Breadboard, Jumper Wires  

### Features
- Real-time temperature and humidity display  
- Continuous sensor reading with stable output  
- Simple, low-cost monitoring system  

### Skills Demonstrated
